# flutter_animation_widgets

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

 1. Curves:- the term curve refers to the speed and motion pattern of an animation over time. Instead of moving linearly from start to finish, animations often follow a curve that defines how quickly or slowly the movement happens at different points in the animation


 2. AnimatedBuilder:-  when a animation involves multiple widgets, animatedbuilder help to update only the widgets that need to change. we can make custom animation with this.
